# Welcome to deepzoomup 
> Easily share your high resolution photos as deep zoom images with the world. 


The ability to create and share web based high resolution interactive deep zoom images is a basic need in almost any heritage science project. Unfortunately this used to be a technically demanding job, out of reach for mortals with limited coding skills. Until now... 


This python package `deepzoomup` can convert your high resolution images and and publish them on-line as interactive deep zoom images on your Backblaze cloud storage. 

# What you need to do 

I assume you have Python installed and know how to run Jupyter notebooks. See: https://anaconda.org/. 

1) Install the package by typing the following command in the terminal: 

    $ pip install deepzoomup (almost available!) 

2) Get an account for cloud storage at Backblaze B2. 

3) Create a public B2 bucket with credentials (id and key) for reading and writing. 

4) Follow the instructions [Uploading your own deep zoom image](https://fligt.github.io/deepzoomup/uploading/)



Here is an example of a cloud stored image that was created with *deepzoomup*:

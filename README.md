# Welcome to deepzoomup 
> Easily share your high resolution photos as deep zoom images with the world. 


Creating large interactive deep zoom images on the web used to be a technically demanding job. Until now. This Python package *deepzoomup* has been made to easily convert your high resolution images and publish them on line as interactive deep zoom images for anyone to admire or study. 

# What you need to do 

I assume you have Python installed and know how to run Jupyter notebooks. See: https://anaconda.org/. 

1) Install the package by typing the following command in the terminal: 

    $ pip install deepzoomup (almost available!) 

2) Get an account for cloud storage at Backblaze B2. 

3) Create a public B2 bucket with credentials (id and key) for reading and writing. 

4) Follow the instructions [Uploading your own deep zoom image](https://fligt.github.io/deepzoomup/uploading/)



Here is an example of a cloud stored image that was created with *deepzoomup*:
